# RAG_PIPELINE
Build an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline over a provided dataset. Expose two FastAPI endpoints for retrieval and generation, and design each component for robustness and high-quality outputs.

---

##  Overview

This project combines cosin similarity search with generative models by:

- preprocessing the data to get better result
- Splitting documents into manageable chunks
- Generating dense vector embeddings using a local embedding model
- Retrieving the most relevant chunks using similarity search and Hybrid Search with filtering data by headings (Qdrant)
- Constructing prompts with top-k chunks
- Generating answers via an LLM

## üì° REST API Endpoints

Your RAG pipeline exposes several RESTful endpoints via FastAPI.

### üìÑ 1. `POST /retrieve`

**Description**:  
Retrieves the top-k most relevant chunks from the document store based on input query and filtered by two metadata ("heading_1","heading_2").

**URL**:  
`http://localhost:8000/retrieve`

**Request Body**:

```json
{
  "query": "Why are the French not considered a unified ethnic group?",
  "heading_1":"",
  "heading_2":""
}
```
Response Example:

"question": "Why are the French not considered a unified ethnic group?",
  "documents": [

      "payload": {
        "heading_1": "People of France",
        "heading_2": "Ethnic groups",
        "text": "The French are, paradoxically, strongly conscious of belonging to a single nation, but they hardly constitute a unified ethnic group by any scientific gauge. Before the official discovery of the Americas at the end of the 15th century, France, located on the western extremity of the Old World, was regarded for centuries by Europeans as being near the edge of the known world. Generations of different migrants traveling by way of the Mediterranean from the Middle East and Africa and through Europe from Central Asia and the Nordic lands settled permanently in France, forming a variegated grouping, almost like a series of geologic strata, since they were unable to migrate any farther. Perhaps the oldest reflection of these migrations is furnished by the Basque people, who live in an isolated area west of the Pyrenees in both Spain and France, who speak a language unrelated to other European languages, and whose origin remains unclear. The Celtic tribes, known to the Romans as Gauls, spread from central Europe in the period"

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammadmolavi/RAG_PIPELINE.git
cd RAG_pipeline
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the API Server
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```
Or just:
```bash
python main.py
```
---
## üîß Running Qdrant with Docker
We use [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) as a vector database for storing and retrieving high-dimensional embeddings.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 1: Run Qdrant in Docker
Run the following command to launch Qdrant locally:
```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
```
This starts the Qdrant server on:
- **REST API:** http://localhost:6333
- **gRPC API:** http://localhost:6334 

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 2: Check Health
Verify Qdrant is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:6333/health
```
should return
```bash
{"status":"ok"}
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 3: Connect from Python
Use qdrant-client to interact with Qdrant:
```bash
pip install qdrant-client
```
Example connection:
```bash
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
client = QdrantClient(host="localhost", port=6333)
client.get_collections()  # List available collections
```

‚úÖ Tip: You can use Qdrant in-memory mode for development, or with persistent storage using volume mounts if needed.
```bash
docker run \
  -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
  -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage \
  qdrant/qdrant
```
